Hi, I'm Isuru Lakshan, a final year Software Engineering student at Sri Lanka Technological Campus. My passion lies in app development and machine learning, and I have a particular interest in front-end development. I'm currently working on my final year project, a driver drowsiness detection system using deep learning. With a focus on continuous learning and innovation, I strive to build impactful software solutions that positively impact people's lives.
